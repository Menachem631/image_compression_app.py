This project creates a streamlit application, designed to display to the user the capabilities of image compression.

In the application, the user can input a photo, and a Singular Value Decomposition is performed on the matrix of the photo. When a compression percentage is selected, four photographs are displayed, one of which has been compressed to the selected percentage.
The user is then asked which photo is the compressed one and is informed if his selection is correct.
